**Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**
**Project Description**

As technology evolves rapidly, new innovations have emerged, but unfortunately, fraudulent activities have also increased. Many innocent individuals face financial losses due to sophisticated banking frauds.

Before the internet revolution, banks relied on traditional methods such as manual reviews, transaction monitoring, and data analytics to detect suspicious activities. However, with technological advancements, fraud cases continue to rise. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning to detect abnormal behaviors in banking transactions, helping banks adapt to evolving fraudulent practices.

The project combines machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest in a stacking classifier to improve performance and detect fraud more accurately. By implementing these technologies, the system enhances overall security, speeds up response time, and increases accuracy in identifying suspicious transactions.
